Basic Neural Net Perceptron

Creates a simple Model with an input layer of 784 neurons, two hidden 16 neuron layers, and finally an output layer of 10 neurons.

All operations are made within this repository including matrix operation code, backpropagation/gradient descent and training/testing.

This model scores 85% accuracy which matches an equivlent tensorflow model trained with same number of epochs and batches.

The dataset used for this is the `fashion-mnist` dataset. Available at: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist
